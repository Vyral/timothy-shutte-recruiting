Today we're talking about the five pillars of Exit Realty and what they mean to us. We believe that if we focus on the Realtor rather than just the numbers, we can grow organically by teaching and training Realtors to be able to produce business and meet their income goals. We do that in five ways.

**1\. Training.** We train you to be the best agent we can by giving you mentorship opportunities from those whoâ€™ve been in the business longer.

**2\. Branding.** We want to train you to be the best at branding yourself to grow your own business.

**3\. Using the best technology.** We teach you to use it so that you can continually grow your business.

**4\. Culture.** We have an awesome culture here in our office, and we'd love to show that to you.

**5\. Financial security.** At Exit Realty, we have a unique residual model where you can earn up to 10% of any Realtor that you sponsor in GCI, up to $10,000 per year.

We believe these five pillars are very important in growing our agents organically. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
