Previously, we talked about how to reach an average of two transactions per month. Today Iâ€™ll go over how to keep that pace through the entire year.

Quite often, I see Realtors stuck in a bell curve where they gear up at the beginning of the year and then taper off. Between April and the end of July, they do 50% to 60% of their transactions. That mainly happens because we don't have our prospecting systems in place and we don't stick to our time blocking.

**How can you make that bell curve into a line and have a steady number of transactions and steady cash flow all year?** Proactive seller lead generations will help you immensely. This comes down to getting systems for listing leads A and B, and filling those pipelines with your expired listings, for sale by owner listings, and any other system that you come up with. These are strategies that you would learn on our team. Next time, I'll discuss more details.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you.
