There are four things we take to a listing presentation when we have an opportunity to work with a new client:

**1\. Pre-listing packet.** This is about five pages long and contains three documents we asked the seller to fill out ahead of time, which include the 10 things they’ll miss about their home, what they’d like about the house if they were the buyer, and a sheet that allows them to rank their concerns about the sale of their home. The first two are similar but not exactly the same—they show different motivations. This packet helps us eliminate many objections the sellers may have and allows us to know where they’re coming from so we can address those things.

**2\. Marketing presentation.** We show them what we’ll do to market their home to get top dollar.

**3\. MLS printouts.** These allow us to go through square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and so on with the sellers to come up with a price we think their home is worth. This is how we work out the listing price.

**4\. Listing paperwork.** We don’t always get to this in that first meeting, but we try to as often as possible. Every seller wants to know what our fees are, so we provide transparency and the final number so they can decide what they want to do.

I present these four things differently every time depending on the seller’s personality. That’s crucial because some people want to know about your marketing first, and others want to get straight to their bottom line and talk about what they’ll net from the sale. During the process, we get to know who they are, their goals, and their motivations, which are valuable in letting us know what they’ll need as clients.

If you have questions about our listing presentation or other real estate matters, call or email us. We would be happy to speak with you.
