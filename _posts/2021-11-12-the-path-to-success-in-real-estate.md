Today let’s talk about the path a Realtor should take to get to $100,000 income.

We know that $3.3 million in GCI at a 3% real estate commission is really close to $100,000. In our marketplace, the average sale price is between $200,000 and $225,000, but let’s suppose it’s $200,000 for the sake of easy math. At a 3% commission, that turns into $6,000 GCI per transaction.

Multiply that by your broker split. It depends on what type of commission plan you’re on, but that often turns into around $5,000 to take home before your various broker and Realtor fees are paid. **That $5,000 times 20 is what it takes to achieve $100,000 commissioned income**, though you’ll want around $130,000 GCI to walk away with that much.

So how do you get 20 to 24 transactions a year? That depends on the price points you work within. In our next few videos, we’ll discuss in more detail what it takes to get that kind of business.
