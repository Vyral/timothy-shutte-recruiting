<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan that you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Timothy Schutte and here at EXIT Realty Capital City we’ve sold hundreds of homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission, consistency, and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">What I like about working here is the team environment. Everyone in the office, the office staff, the other agents, we’re all willing to build each other up and help each other out. If you have a question or something that you would like to bounce off of somebody, there’s always someone available in the office that can help you out with that.</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">Traditional training doesn’t work for me. I’ve found that I’ve been getting a good amount of mentoring and person-to-person interaction to where I’ve never felt lost. It seems like I can always find the right course of action no matter the situation.</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money for a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free and in return, maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Timothy Schutte</p>
