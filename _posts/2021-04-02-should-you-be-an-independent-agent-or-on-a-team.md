Should you be on a real estate team or an independent agent? When I first started in the industry in 2007, there wasn’t much of a team model. Though the team model continually evolves, you get three essential things from working with a team:

**1\. Leads.** The leads you get from processes already in place are crucial.

**2\. Accountability.** Accountability is vital for many personality types, and sometimes a team is more suited to certain personality types than others

**3\. More hands-on training.** You’ll have daily huddles, accountability meetings, and do role-play.

Despite all those benefits, there is one disadvantage to working on a team: You often receive a lower commission split per transaction. However, as I’ve frequently seen, you may net the same amount or more money on a team because you have more opportunities to do more transactions.&nbsp;

If you’re deciding whether to be an independent agent, ask yourself: **Can you be a self-starter?** Can you generate your own leads and do enough transactions? That depends on what you want your income to be and whether you’re able to do enough business by yourself to meet that number. Do you need the accountability and lead generation that a team provides? Consider these things before deciding to strike out on your own.&nbsp;

If you have questions about which path is right for you or concerning any other real estate topic, reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to help you.
