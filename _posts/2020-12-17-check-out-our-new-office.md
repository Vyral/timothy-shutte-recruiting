<center><em>Here’s why we’re very excited about the new year at EXIT Realty.</em></center>

2020 is drawing to a close, and today I’m standing inside one of the things that makes us very excited for next year. The unfinished building you see behind me in the video above is the new EXIT Realty office on the corner of 70th and Hickman. **Our new office will include a shared lounge, coffee bar, and training room**; it’ll be a modern facility with modern amenities. We love this space and what we’ll be able to offer our clients from it.&nbsp;

Just the other day we finished our 2021 vision board to determine our goals for the coming year. We’re eager for 2021 to begin.

We would love to speak with you about what we do to sell real estate and how we train our agents. If you have any questions, fill out the contact form on our website, and we’d be glad to reach out to you about it.
