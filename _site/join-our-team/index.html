<p>Dear Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>I understand you’re a newly licensed Realtor or are in the process of obtaining your license and looking for the kind of mentorship, training, family culture, and technology that will boost your career.</p>

<p>Brand-new agents have a lot of pain not knowing where their leads come from, and they typically don’t have the experience or database to do transactions right away. They’re also uncertain about a lot of things, including filing basic paperwork, organizing a database, formulating their business plan, and executing it.</p>

<p>Experienced agents know how to do these tasks, but perhaps don’t know how to increase their business from point A to point B. Maybe they’re a buyer’s agent who needs to learn how to handle listings, or vice versa. In any case, they don’t have the mentoring they need to learn these tasks. This is why the first two years of being a Realtor are the hardest. This is the time frame when most either get a second job or fizzle out. </p>

<p>To solve this problem, many seek out people who can give them answers, like their broker. The problem is, a lot of brokers aren’t set up for mentorship and providing leads, and if they are,  they don’t stick around long-term. Figuring out how to find leads and convert them ends up keeping agents up at 3 a.m. If this problem goes unsolved, their transactions fall apart, and they’ll keep waking up at 3 a.m.</p>

<img src="/img/001.jpg" alt="Timothy Schutte" class="three-quarter-image" />

<p>My name is Timothy Schutte, and if you don’t want to be one of these agents staying up night after night until 3 a.m., I have a solution for you. </p>

<p>You see, I’ve been in your shoes. I got my real estate license as a sophomore in college, and I struggled for the first three years of my career. During the first year, I only did nine transactions. In year two, that number only increased to 11. In year three, a first-time homebuyer tax credit helped me sell 25 homes to friends of mine from January to July. When that program expired, though, I only sold one home the rest of the year. </p>

<p>After that, the ultimatum was clear: either get serious about this business or get another job. In December of that year, I hired a coach who taught me how to prospect and get deals done. The next year, I did 50 transactions. The year after that, I did 78. During this time, I founded my own team, started working with investment properties, and created multiple streams of income. I love helping people find their wealth and ensuring they aren’t living paycheck to paycheck. Their sales should be gratifying enough to enjoy their careers. </p>

<p>I’ve been in business for 13 years now. I have 20 rental properties, I flip five to 10 houses a year, I’ve developed land, and I’ve handled a condo conversion project. All of this is to say that my team and I bring the best solution to real estate. </p>

<p>My solution is this: I will help you develop a large network and database with a constant stream of business. I’ll also help you understand the ebbs and flows of the marketplace and be prepared for them. Some months are always weaker than others, but we keep agents accountable for their dreams and help them achieve them. </p>

<p>You’ll be given hands-on training from a broker who knows the business, participates in it, and helps you hit every goal on your vision board. Each morning, we have morning huddles that form the backbone of our mentorship. Additionally, a team like ours can offer you more leads than a brokerage can. We use Boomtown as our CRM, and it allows us to generate leads, scrub those leads, and communicate with them over time. Our proprietary software transfers listings into Facebook and links them back into our CRM. This, in turn, creates more transactions. </p>

<p>The best part is, we also offer 10% sponsoring residuals, which means you can make upwards of $10,000 per year by sponsoring new agents! </p>

<img src="/img/002.jpg" alt="Timothy Schutte" class="half-image" />

<p>The systems of our solution create more conversations, leads, and transactions. This will boost your sales revenue so that you meet your vision board. Aside from the numbers, our office culture is collaborative and supportive. We celebrate our agents’ successes both inside and outside of the industry. </p>

<p>Of course, there are plenty of brokerages you can work for. The traditional models, however, offer minimal training and require a lot of cold calls. They train you how to complete a transaction, but not how to find leads. Then you have brokers who teach you how to prospect but not how to complete a transaction. Lastly, other real estate teams will give you leads but won’t mentor you. A true team like ours fosters a collaborative environment in order to bring the best solution to real estate.</p>

<p>You don’t have to take my word for it. Consider the success stories of some of our top agents:</p>

<p>Brandi started last August as an admin but got her license when I went on vacation. She helped deliver a transaction for us and found out that she liked the work involved. Her goal for 2020 at the start of the year was 12 transactions, but she’s on pace to double that, all by following the systems we have in place.
Jasmina joined us in April 2019, and she did 18 transactions before the year was over. She was willing to pick up the phone and use the buyer and seller scripts we provided. She has the right personality and skill set to meet all of her goals. </p>

<p>What is your offer?</p>

<p>If you take our offer, our online training system will help with your initial start-up. Additionally, we hold topic-based training sessions every Tuesday in our office. Also, we show a property once a month under different circumstances so agents know what to do with a house with a bad foundation, new builds, etc. In short, we want to train and mentor you to do the best that you can. If you follow our training systems and schedule, we guarantee you’ll do at least seven transactions in your first year. </p>

<p>Our ongoing training is geared specifically for this time of year, so there’s no time like the present to respond to this offer. Our company is invite-only. We don’t want bad apples or anyone who’d dilute our culture. We're embarking on a new decade, and it’s an exciting time for you to start your career. </p>

<p>I look forward to talking to you soon!</p>

<p>Timothy Schutte</p>
