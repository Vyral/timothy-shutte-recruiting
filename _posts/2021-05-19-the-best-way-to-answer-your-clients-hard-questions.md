Today I’ll address a few questions that may come up during a listing presentation that can catch you off-guard and how to be prepared for them.

Recently, we were holding a listing presentation where the clients had a ton of questions for us. It was a fun experience because they were educated about the process; they’ve been through four sales in the last 10 years due to relocation and this was their first non-relocation deal. They asked us a few questions that kept us on our toes, and as agents, we need to be ready for those types of inquiries.

One of these questions was, “What do your current clients say about you that you think we should know?” When answering this question, **don’t come across as a braggart or an egoist, but do try to appear knowledgeable and experienced.** We responded by saying that clients have described us as service-oriented, educated, and very knowledgeable about what the marketplace was doing.

As a follow-up, be sure to send clients your Zillow reviews to give them an idea of what people are saying about you. Don’t lie to make yourself sound better; people can always figure that out, and if they do, it can completely torpedo your opportunity to work with them.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how to handle tough questions and objects during a listing presentation, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to have a conversation with you.
