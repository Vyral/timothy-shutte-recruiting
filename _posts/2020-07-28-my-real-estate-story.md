 <p style="text-align: center;"><em>
Here’s a quick retelling of my journey in real estate.</em></p>

I started full-time in real estate in 2007 while also attending college. I did nine transactions during my first year at a brokerage where they trained me how to do the paperwork properly, but I struggled with finding clients and sales. **The training wasn’t there for what I really needed and it took me quite a few years to figure that out.**

I ended up hiring a real estate coach in the fall of 2010 right after the first-time homebuyer $8,000 tax credit was introduced. I ended up selling 25 properties in the first six months of the year and spent that money thinking I would sell 50. That’s not how the business goes, however, and I didn’t sell another house for the rest of the year.&nbsp;

I gave myself one more year (2011) to either succeed or go find another job. That’s when the coaching paid, off and I hired an assistant in 2011, doubled my business, and then kept doubling it for another two years.

I ended up joining a small brokerage, continued to work on my business, then was able to open my own Exit Realty franchise in 2013. **Seven years later, we’re still here, still growing, and have the systems in place for new agents that I was never taught when I was starting out.**

If I wouldn’t have hired my coach and had that change in my lifestyle, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I would more than likely be climbing the corporate ladder somewhere hoping to succeed. I’ve been able to create my own destiny on this path, continue to push for what I want, and hit the goals that I set for myself when I was younger so that I can live the life that I want to.

**My main goal these days is to help our agents grow both internally and externally.** I don’t want to have the biggest brokerage or the smallest brokerage, but I want to have the best agents who are driven to succeed. As a group, we love what we’re doing and where we're going, and we’re going to continue to build on that.

If you have any questions about our brokerage or about the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
