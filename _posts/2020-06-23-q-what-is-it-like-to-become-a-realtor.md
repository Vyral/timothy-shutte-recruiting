Today I’ll dispel some common misconceptions about becoming a Realtor in Iowa.

In the state of Iowa, the average Realtor salaries are compensations of about $50,000. People who come into the real estate industry often think that they’ll be making a lot of money, but that isn’t always true. The top 20% of Realtors do 80% of the business. The first two years of being a Realtor can be quite a struggle sometimes, but one of the things I love about the industry is the unlimited income potential you can have.

Many new agents think they’ll have all this freedom with their time because they won’t have a boss in a corporate setting always telling them what to do. That’s somewhat true from the standpoint that you have a set schedule for the day. However, t**he best thing you can do as a new agent is to time block portions of the day for prospecting, making calls, going on appointments, etc.** Some of the most successful Realtors start their day at 8 a.m. and work late into the evening. Another aspect of becoming a Realtor involving your time is that **you’ll have to go through state-certified classes**; 60 hours for pre-licensing and 36 hours of in-class (or online) lessons. These lessons do help you understand what Realtor does, but they don’t help you prospect or plan the day-to-day activities that will be key to your success.

The journey to becoming a Realtor can be stressful and involves a lot of hard work. Since your broker won’t hold you accountable for your own success, **you’ll have to find another way to hold yourself accountable.** On our team, we have a daily huddle at 8:15 a.m. for 30 minutes to wrap up the previous day, celebrate our successes, and to work on our failures. This is one of the many things that make us successful here at Exit Realty Capital City.
