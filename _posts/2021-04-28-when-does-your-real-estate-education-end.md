Does your education end once you receive your real estate license? To answer that question, there are two other questions you need to address: 1) What are the legal requirements? and 2) What makes you a successful Realtor?

Legally, you’re required to complete 36 hours’ worth of education every two years once you have your real estate license, and this education does help you become a better Realtor. **At the end of the day, though,** **you need to be educating yourself all the time.** In today’s hot seller’s market, it’s important to know how to do a market analysis and check what a property is actually worth if you think it’s listed either too high or too low. I’ve seen both instances happen in just the past week.

I recently ran into an appraiser with 35 years of experience in the business, and when I asked him how it’s going in today’s market, he said he didn’t even feel like he knew what he was doing because home prices are so high. He’s struggling to evaluate homes because of how much has changed. In my opinion, the moment you receive your real estate license is when your education starts. There’s so much more to learn if you want to become a proficient Realtor in our marketplace.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know about how to properly educate yourself as a Realtor or have any questions for me, feel free to call or email me anytime. I’d love to speak with you.
