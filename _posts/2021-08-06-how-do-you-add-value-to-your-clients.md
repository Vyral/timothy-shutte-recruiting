When my team and I attend listing appointments, we often come across clients who ask for reduced commissions for various reasons. Most of the requests come in because they think it’s a seller’s market so they shouldn’t have to pay as much as normal. In a seller’s market, it’s true that our job can sometimes be easier on the marketing front. However, there’s much more to the job than that.&nbsp;

What are you offering to your clients in terms of value? If you walk into a listing appointment and claim you’re a master of staging but the homeowner’s listing doesn’t really need that, what other types of value are you offering that client? The way I look at it, **our services as a whole provide a lot of value no matter what the situation.** Getting the transaction from contract to close, for example, is a value. Marketing is a value as well.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, though, it all boils down to what the client wants, so you have to dig deep to find out their motivations. Why do they want to sell? Why do they want to make a new purchase? Where do they want to go? Making a stress-free transaction is important, as is being knowledgeable. That value can come from experience, but it can also come from just meeting the client’s needs.&nbsp;

When it comes to value propositions on the buyer side, they often think of us Realtors as free. That’s mostly true, but at the same time, you have to secure these clients by establishing relationships that add more value based on you being knowledgeable and hearing their needs.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that in my experience, **the best way to add value to your clients is by being knowledgeable and meeting the needs of their purchase or sale.**&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk more about adding value to your clients or have any questions at all, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
