Anne Ades joined me to talk about her first two months on our team.

Today I’m joined by Anne Ades, a new agent with Exit First Realty who just got licensed a mere two months ago. **She chose to join Exit First Realty based on her experience working with us as a client** and also getting referred to our team by another agent. She knew she was joining a team that would help her grow her business over time.

Anne has always been a dedicated salesperson in her past positions. She says to be able to have her own business and use those skills to grow it was a dream come true.

Since she started with us, Anne already has two deals underway. One she received as a referral from another Exit brokerage in eastern Iowa, and the other is a referral from another agent on our team, and both are closing at the end of the month. Two months in, and two deals nearing the finish line.

**Anne describes the culture here as inclusive.** Everyone is ready, willing, and able to train, coach, share information, and bring each other up. It’s not something that you always find in the real estate business. As far as her future is concerned, Anne would love to be able to get to 25 transactions next year while also learning the ins and outs of the business so that she is ready to pay it forward to our future new agents.

If you have any real estate questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
