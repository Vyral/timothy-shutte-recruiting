*Here’s why new agent Justin Torres joined our team at EXIT Realty.*

Justin Torres previously worked at an EXIT Realty group in Colorado Springs before he came back to the Des Moines metro area, where he bounced around to a few different brokerages. Recently, he came back to us, but what brought him here?

According to him, it’s the overwhelmingly positive culture we foster here. We help other agents build on their strengths and become not just good agents, but also better people. He’s only been with us for a short time, but Justin has already put a few contracts together, which is momentum that **he attributes to being immersed in our positive culture where we support each other.**

It’s more than just the culture; having the *opportunity* to do better as far as open houses, interacting with clients, role-playing, and more go a long way, even though he’s been in the business for three years. Justin also has a new recruit that he’s sponsored into the active system. He sees it as an opportunity to create a quality, productive agent.

Here at EXIT Realty, we also like to have fun. **Real estate can be a very stressful industry, so it’s important to know how to keep it light for our agents.&nbsp;**
