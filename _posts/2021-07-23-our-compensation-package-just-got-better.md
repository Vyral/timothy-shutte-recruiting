Today, I’m here to bring you some exciting news on our new compensation plan. Our standard policy in the past has been 70/30 up to 100,000 GCI, and then 90/10 after that. However, **we recently increased our compensation based on production level as well as any sponsorships you might have.** At Exit Realty, if you sponsor another Realtor in North America, you can bring in 10% of their GCI as long as they are also with Exit Realty. This is a pretty unique situation, and while 10% may not sound like a lot now, it adds up very quickly.&nbsp;

For example, Exit Realty has paid over $500 million in residual bonuses in North America. This type of compensation is part of what makes Exit Realty one of the best places for real estate teams to work.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would just like to sit down for a coffee, please reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
