<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s everything you need to know about my twice-monthly newsletter.</em></p>

Hey there fellow Des Moines agent,&nbsp;

If you weren’t already aware, my name is Timothy Schutte, leader of The Timothy Schutte Real Estate Team with EXIT Realty Capital City. I wanted to let you know that I started publishing videos on what we’re doing to sell real estate in Des Moines, and **they contain my best lead generation, marketing, and business tips right here in our MLS.** It’s all free—no catch whatsoever.&nbsp;

If you’d like to sign up, I send out two emails a month and nothing else; each one has my latest video linked in it, and you’ll get to see what we’re up to, what tactics work in our industry and specific market, and how we continually innovate to help area buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

The videos are geared for current agents here in Des Moines, as well as anybody who’s looking to get into the real estate business. I truly hope you enjoy them; you can sign up on the next page\!

In the meantime, reach out to me by phone or email if you have any questions for me. I’d love to hear from you.
