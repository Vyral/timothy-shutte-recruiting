*Today I’m joined by Realtor Dani Yegge to discuss why she got into the real estate business.*

Today’s guest Dani Yegge has been a Realtor for a year and a half, but I wanted to sit down with her for a conversation about what led her to a career in this industry.

“I went to college for nursing and I decided that wasn’t the path I wanted to go,” Dani said. Her mom was a broker in a different market and Dani decided that she wanted to do that full time here in Des Moines.

Starting off in real estate isn’t the easiest thing to do anymore, but that didn’t stop Dani. “**I’ve learned that it’s a very self-rewarding job.** As much work as you put in, you’ll get out. I learned that the hard way,” she reflected.

However she’s loved her experience with EXIT Realty so far. “I’ve had nothing but a great experience here with the team and brokerage as a whole.”

As far as the spark that has given Dani her motivation over the last six months, **Dani points to “the fact that everyone motivates each other and pushes each other to get our transactions done.”**&nbsp;That’s a reflection of our team’s culture, too. We have a very supportive atmosphere, we collaborate well, and if anyone ever has a question, there’s someone there to answer it. “Everyone helps out from start to finish.”

Last month, Dani attended one of our three-hour workshops and found that it was beneficial for her to go back over the basics step-by-step. She also created a vision board to remind her of all the things that she wants to accomplish.

I appreciate Dani spending the time to talk about her journey into the real estate industry. If you have any questions about a career in real estate or what life is like on the EXIT Realty Team, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.
